        <p class="intro"> Hi, My name is Mayen Akpan, I live in Portland Oregon, I am a Software Developer and I love to code. </p>

        <p>Growing upon a small town, and a small community, I was always curious, and eager to explore. I never really thought I would love doing something the way I love to code.</p>

      <p>Technology is changing, and the world is evolving so creating things, and building softwares application allows me too express myself in a creative way.</p>

        <h2> About Me</h2>
        <div class="group">
        <div class='item-double'>
     
        <p>I love to code because it is a usable art, a team effort, it makes a difference in peoples lives, and itâ€™s fun.</p>

        <p>Just like architecture, which is an art used by people daily and affects their everyday life, so is code. You can create something and people interact with, use, touch and work with. That is an amazing feeling.</p>

        <p>Since code is a usable art, a whole team of people are connected to the practice. From the client to the account managers, and including the business people, finance, the support team, QA team, designers, product managers and project managers. Code touches every single person in the organization and makes a difference to every single user that touches it.</p>

        <p>When I am not writing codes, cooking, and sorting through food menu at a restaurant I am spending time with my family.</p>
